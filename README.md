# Movies-ETL

## Overview
For the Amazing Prime Hackathon, the purpose of this project was to create an automated pipleine that takes in data from Wikipedia Data, Kaggle Metadata, and the MovieLens rating Data to assemble a movie database.  

The ETL process was used to exxtract the Wikipedia and kaggle data from their respective files, transform the datasets by cleaning rows and formating datatypes, performing joins, and loading the cleaned dataset into a SQL Database.
